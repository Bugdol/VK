it costs nearly as much money to collect tolls as it does to just build the damn highway so the information that the customer sees is heavily distorted by the process of having to collect that informationSo based on this I can derive some general principles for the role of government:1 It should provide the institutional framework necessary for the market to function at all eg contract laws and defense2 It should rectify the lemon problem where sellers conceal vital information from buyers or vice-versa eg consumer protection laws implied warranties truth-in-advertising laws full disclosure on mortgages SEC regulation etc3 It should prevent companies from leveraging a monopoly to enter a market4 It should rectify externalities where a firm takes something of value to others but doesnt pay for it usually because its too difficult to arrange a transaction  The classic example is pollution5 It should provide goods and services where the transaction cost of attempting to measure and restrict usage is greater than the actual value of the service  Markets will never develop in these areas otherwise  A good example would be roadsSome concrete examples whichll probably seem kinda out-there:To start I wouldnt have any taxes at all  Instead the government owns all land and raises revenue by auctioning off leases on land natural resources and pollution credits  These leases would be tradable subdividable securities and would be subject to normal SEC prohibitions on disclosure and insider trading  If you wanted to construct a skyscraper that you expect to last 50 years youd buy a 50-year lease on the land  If you ended up selling it after 20 you could sell the lease on the open market but the land itself would revert back to the government after another 30 years  The government can also buy the lease back by paying market ratesThis helps the externality problem because every time the voters want to prevent something like a polluting factory they have the legal ability to but they also have a precise dollar figure for how much itll cost in economic terms  If people dont want oil companies to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge they can simply block the lease on drilling rights but it will cost them a few billion dollars  Then they can decide whether the economic value to oil companies is worth more than the government services they will receive from itAs for spending itself - roads are an obvious one because the transaction costs of tolls are hellish  Defense is another one - I dont think we need to spend quite so much as we do but we do need a strong militaryI would not provide free education other than the basic literacy and civic requirements necessary for democracy to function  You tend to get what you pay for  Free education not only leads to bureacratic uncaring schoolboards but it also leads to freeriding uncaring schoolchildren  Instead Id create rigorous public evaluations of all schools - not necessarily tests which generally reflect the politicians biases more than actually useful information but statistics about where graduates end up satisfaction levels evaluations from past students etc  Then let people choose - and spend their own money - on schools  Since people shouldnt be denied education based on what their parents do there should be loans available - but through the private sector not public  Also education has a problem in that it takes years for it to pay off and market conditions can change dramatically between when you enter and when you exit  To insure against this Id create a tradable derivative called salary futures again through the private sector  This is not insurance on your salary that would have a huge moral hazard problem but rather a promise to pay the change in the difference between the average salaries of two professions  These can be bundled into funds if necessary to diversify across the whole economy  So if you want to become an engineer but find that salaries have gone way down by the time you graduate your salary future will kick in with the difference for X number of years and then you can decide whether to stick with it or retrain as a lawyerHealth care is tricky because nobody wants to die and if life really is priceless then people should be willing to pay infinite amounts of money to avoid dying  Markets arent meant to deal with infinities Id need to think about this I suppose if I actually came up with a workable solution Id be rich and famous and wouldnt be posting it on a glorified message board -',\n",

              "  'comment': 'After the introduction of the topic of acquisition from the buyer to the seller the first major milestone in an acquisition deal is usually a terms sheet  The terms sheet would be essentially a non-binding high-level agreement to the basic terms of the deal  Price is just one of many terms  It is clearly one of the important ones but there are other sometimes equally important terms in a given deal such as associated non-compete and consulting contracts  Also price is a nebulous term and is usually not just one isolated number  For instance there can be earn-outs hold-backs escrowed amounts consulting fees etc and all of these can be tied to indemnities conditions etc  And the structure of the deal eg stock vs asset impacts the net take home to the shareholders which is what most people are ultimately interested inBoth parties agree on the terms sheet through negotiation  That sounds obvious but the point is there is not one set process  There are many strategies to negotiation and some make more sense than others in the context of a particular deal  It is not uncommon for parties to walk away and come back to the table at this stage and in fact at all stages  The price could easily move up or down significantly depending on a number of factors  It really comes down to what the seller is willing to sell for and what the buyer is willing to buy for  If there is an overlap there could be a deal  If not then no deal  The rest is jockeying for the overlap  Walking away until you get x is one tactic to get to the top of the overlap from your perspectiveFinally investment bankers and their equivalents in these situations are not necessary but they can get you a higher price  Their basic usefulness is connecting you to potential buyers ie through their roladex  You alone may not know or have access to these potential buyers  By engaging multiple buyers you can get an auction scenario which is often ideal because usually buyers willing to pay more for something if they are taking it away from someone else in addition to getting it for themselves  However certain tactics can turn off and ultimately dislodge particular buyers from the process which could be net negative for the shareholders depending on which buyers walked away  Also brokers usually take a significant % fee and if they do not get an auction going this could just be wasted money',\n",
